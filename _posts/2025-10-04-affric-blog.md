## Easter Weekend in Glen Affric
### 18-21st April, 2025.

Earlier on this year I booked the Glen Affric Youth Hostel for the Easter bank holiday - I had somehow managed to go through many years of Highlands adventures without knowing of its existence, but once I found it, I knew I had to visit!

I drove up to the River Affric car park from Glasgow on the Bank Holiday Friday: the weather was that sort of ominous, blustery grey that fills you with apprehension when heading into the mountains.

It’s a stunning 8-9 mile walk into the Glen, along the side of Loch Affric, to get to the hostel. I didn’t see a soul - only adding to the sense of adventure as I headed further from civilisation, not really knowing what to expect at the hostel. I’ve been to Loch Affric once before, back then it was a glorious heat-wave summer’s day. This time the hills were shrouded in cloud, the mountain drama dial was turned to max.

At the hostel I was greeted by the warden who showed me around and quickly had a fire going in the kitchen. There was around 8 people I guess, including a few who were camping outside. It’s a simple set-up: some basic gas-powered electricity which is turned off in the evenings, no heating and a pretty tepid shower. But the true magic is around the fire in the evening. After getting warm and dry, looking out into the wet and moody emptiness whilst sitting next to a roaring fire was a great way to start the weekend.

I woke up to steady rain and cloud-covered tops. My plan was to do three nearest munro’s today: An Socach, Mullach na Dheiragain and Sgurr nan Caethreamnhnan. I made good time up the first, but hit the snow line around two thirds of the way up - the sort of wet and slippy kind that makes moving quickly quite tricky. It was raining pretty heaving on and off, but up high this turned into snow.

It was a desolate and totally isolated walk - after over-taking two people from the hostel early on, I didn’t see anyone else all day. For most of the day the views were minimal, and on the tops the visibility was close to zero. It was dark, grey and very wet from above and below.

There would be the odd moment where the clouds would clear, leaving a beautiful wintry scene. I hadn’t expected the snow to be so deep this late, but at points it was up past my knees on the way up to the third and final munro. It was a long slog, and as I reached the summit it was a total whiteout - I had to use the GPS and compass to find the way back down.

Back in the hostel the evening was full of sharing adventures from the day around the fire. One lady cooked a whole crumble from scratch in the hostel oven and shared it around. This really put to shame everyone else’s dehydrated meals.

Waking up on Sunday morning was like I had been transported to another continent. It was blue skies, warm and completely still. A very kind lady from Glasgow had left a creme egg on my bed to have when I made it to my summit today, since she had to leave early to drive home. On the recommendation of the warden, I chose to do A Ghlas Beinn and Beinn Fhada. This day quickly became one of the best days I have ever had. 

There’s something in the air in Glen Affric - it feels magical in a way that is hard to describe. It’s quite a long, broad ridge to get up to A Ghlas Beinn, but the views behind me over Beinn Fhada and Glen Affric were completely mind-blowing. The combination of the blue skies, sharp snow line and perfect visibility made it truly magnificent. Looking over to the mountains I climbed yesterday was funny - it’s hard to believe less than 24hours ago I was in a whiteout with all my layers on and two pairs of gloves…this morning I’m in shorts.

I retraced my steps and then turned right to head up the back of Beinn Fhada. Despite there being no snow on top of the first munro, the top of Beinn Fhada was dusted with a pristine layer of fresh snow from yesterday. This was without question one of the most beautiful summit I have ever had in Scotland I had my celebratory creme egg and meandered very slowly along the ridge and down the side of the mountain.

I was back at the hostel early afternoon, before it opened back up for the evening, so I grabbed my book and sat with my legs in the river for a while.

The peace and quiet of Glen Affric is very hard to leave. Having experienced such wildly varying conditions, it felt like I’d been away from civilisation for a long time. The sun was shining as I slowly ambled back to the car, my knees protesting against my lack of mountain time in the last few weeks. 

A few fellow hostel-goers passed me on their bikes on the way out. There was one particularly memorable interaction:

Man on bike: “How many munro’s have you got left?”

Me: “Over 100 - long way to go!”

Man on bike: “are you married yet?”

Me: “No…”

Man on bike: “Don’t bother until you’ve got at least 200 under your belt, that’s my advice”

Good words to live by.
