## Kyrgyzstan’s Ak Suu Traverse
### August, 2025.


18.08.

This post begins a few days into our trip around Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan. After landing in Almaty, we spent a few days exploring Altyn Emel National Park and took a very circuitous route around vast empty landscapes to cross into Kyrgyzstan and reach Karakol for the start of our main adventure.

Karakol has such great energy. It feels so alive, with people and vehicles everywhere. The huge mountains loom over you in the distance. On the night we arrived a big rainstorm had just passed - the mountains were shrouded in clouds, adding to the drama and nerves of what was to come.

We based this entire trip on a Youtube video we saw of someone doing the Ak Suu Traverse. It looked incredible, and we decided to go for it. There is not a huge amount of information about the trek online, and so there were a few significant unknowns for us as we piled alien Kyrgyzstan chocolate bars into our bags and did some last minute sorting.


19.08.

Didn’t sleep very well, feeling very aware of the scale and might of the mountains awaiting. This felt like the biggest adventure I’ve taken on: bigger mountains, high altitude camps, significant stretches of remoteness. I was definitely feeling apprehensive.

We got a local taxi to take us to Boz-Uchuk town, the start of our trek. Many hand signals were deployed to try to sustain a 40 minute conversation with the driver. He was extremely friendly, but not willing to take us 1cm beyond the end of the tarmac!

Spirits were very high as we set off into an already baking hot day. We followed a long gravel track for several kilometres as we winded up through a forest and passed a few yurt camps. The heat was punishing, not to mention the fully-loaded packs that we were all trying to get used to. The steep climbs really highlighted the altitude: we were going from 1,800m to 3,400m today.

As we climbed we got our first taste of the classic Kyrg mountain scenery: lush green alpine meadows, massive rivers and snow-capped peaks behind. And of-course, not a soul in sight.

We reached Boz-Uchuk lake after about 6 hours, finishing with a gruellingly steep climb up from a yurt camp in the valley (where most people sleep) to the lake. I think a mixture of the jet lag, altitude, heat, and tiredness made this moment totally euphoric. Getting the first view of the lake, nestled in the middle of an amphitheatre of rock towers, was an amazing feeling.

In brief periods of calm, the water would turn to glass - perfectly reflecting everything around us. We stayed out long after a postcard sunset, perched on a boulder ideally tilted for lying on your back and star-gazing. I lost count of the number of shooting stars we saw.

It’s fair to say this was the high point of a soon-to-be very rough evening. The temperature dipped aggressively - I was just about warm enough to not be worried, but definitely not enough to get any sleep, wearing all the layers I was carrying inside my sleeping bag! Thankfully most nights of the trek would involve sleeping a bit lower - but it was an important reminder of where we were, and what we were taking on!

20.08.

The good thing about lying in your sleeping bag shivering all night is that you are very highly incentivized to get out and watch the sunrise to warm up. I had it all to myself, watching as the sky went from totally full of stars, to faint strands of morning light, to an electric blue sky. It’s hard to think of a day that has started better. That’s what is so amazing about these adventures: you can go from rock-bottom (putting on your last layer at 1am and realising it isn’t enough), to this feeling, in a matter of hours. It really feels like you squeeze a lifetime into each 24 hours.

Today we had three mountain passes to cross. The first was a little bump straight after leaving camp, before dropping down into a beautiful empty valley and winding along next to a river before beginning the assault on number 2. We followed a few specs ahead of us, who helpfully led us totally off path and we had to hack our way up some rough ground. This was our first interaction with a group of three very friendly kiwis who we’d see periodically throughout the week.

At the top there was a sharp ridge, pointing directly at a huge snow-capped peak in the distance. It looked like a painting, it felt like there was a gravitational pull enticing me along the ridge and wanting me to reach out and touch the mountain in the distance.

Unfortunately we had to leave one member of our group of three behind at the next yurt camp due to injury. Little did we know that he was soon to have a very eventful two days trying to get out of the valley on horseback in a snowstorm! However, we ploughed on - with considerable distance still to go before reaching our planned destination.

The route never lets up. Pass number 3 was just over 3,700m before dropping down into Almaluu Gorge for camp. The weather just began to turn as we headed down, becoming grey and increasingly ominous.

We camped next to a yurt camp, and had some tea inside a yurt to warm up a bit as the temperature dipped. The family who ran the camp had a huge bonfire and group singing session. When they asked around for people to sing other songs, a fellow Brit started up a chorus of “Last Christmas” - in August. A bizarre and truly unique evening!


21.08.

Today the plan was to get to Altyn Arashan. We’d heard from various people we’d passed that the weather wasn’t looking good today, so we started early and hoped to get over the pass before things took a turn.

A brutal climb, probably around 3 hours of head-down grind. In the final hour the wind and snow came, along with some aggressive thunder and lightning. We paused, but decided our best course was just to get over the top and head down quickly. A stark change from the bright blue skies of yesterday.

By the time we dropped down, the weather was clearing and it warmed up nicely. We arrived in Altyn Arashan in the early afternoon and had considerable time to dry some stuff, relax and clean our clothes in the river. This is the most “civilised” part of the trek - where a main road brings tourists to do day-hikes in the area. With hindsight we should have just kept walking and camped later, because the area felt very touristy and quite busy.

22.08.

This was the biggest day of all, getting up and over Alakol Pass at 3,920m. The path doesn’t really mess around - from the camp site it was basically just straight up for hours and hours and hours. Being passed by groups of tourists on horse-back did nothing for morale! The final few hundred metres involved some very loose scree, we were glad to catch up to a guided group so we could follow their path. Happily after a few days walking and sleeping at altitude I was feeling pretty good. Whilst the walking is very hard going, I had no adverse symptoms.

At the top we had an epic birds-eye view down onto the remarkable glacier and lake below. What a place!

On the way down we joined forces with another pair doing the trek, having lunch, a swim, and eventually setting up camp with them further down the valley just above Karakol Gorge. This area after the lakes was very touristy and to be honest not very nice: more litter, lots of loud yurt camps and signs of human existence!

23.08.

We ambled down to the gorge and based on dubious forecasts for the next day decided to leave the bags and do an up-and-down day, before going back to Karakol, rather than camping high for one last night. 

A helpfully catastrophic navigation error from me meant that we powered up a hill that went nowhere. We had a great view, but at that point called it quits and went back for the bags.

Our injured friend came to pick us up, braving the worst road I have ever had the pleasure of being in a car on. It took us probably 2 hours to do about 10km (in a 4x4), driving through massive puddles, enormous holes and over huge boulders.

I do find it hard finishing multi-day things like this. I love the rhythm, simplicity and calm of hiking and camping. The feeling of having everything you need on your back, the unknown of the day/ where you will sleep/ where you’ll find water. Whilst the conveniences of Karakol were much appreciated after multiple nights of shivering “sleep”, my heart was still up over 3,000m.




24-30.08

In our remaining time in the area we mostly road-tripped, first around the Sary-Jaz valley and then back into Kazakhstan and up to the Assy Plateau. With the extra power of the car, we could really disappear into the total wilderness of the region. In Sary-Jaz it felt like we were hundreds of kilometres from the nearest person. We camped over 3,000m with views of 7,000+m peaks in the distance:

and drove on some truly wild gravel roads:

Finally back in Almaty we had a slightly more sedate last two days, including a totally surreal morning in the Arasan baths and a run in with the army near Big Almaty Lake!

I left Kyrgyzstan with a real love for the place. I’ve never been anywhere quite like it. The people were incredibly friendly, the scenery is magnificent, and the feel of the place is just really special.
